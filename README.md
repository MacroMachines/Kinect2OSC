# Kinect2OSC

Experimental Kinect2OSC version made in processing (because keeping up with oF is painfull).

Requires additional libraries:

- [controlP5](https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5) - nice controls
- [oscP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/) - osc communication
- [opencv](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing) - optical flow
- [openkinect](http://shiffman.net/p5/kinect/) - for kinect

## NPM Module

There's counterpart to this application - [kinect2osc-receiver](https://github.com/szymonkaliski/kinect2osc-receiver) - released as npm module (currently available only from github), for easy interfacing with node.js/Plask applications. It's untested with processing version of Kinect2OSC, but might be a good place to start developing.
